# AI-vibes-check
Dataset of Reddit posts from **professional and creative subreddits** discussing AI-related topics.

This repository includes:
1. A dataset of 2,078 Reddit posts collected on 5/19/2025 
2. An updated dataset of 2,082 posts collected on 5/20/2025
3. Python script for scraping posts via Reddit's API. You will need API credentials to run it. (**scrape.py**)
4. Python script for sentiment analysis using TextBlob. (**sentiment_analysis.py**)
5. Python script combining (1) sentiment analysis using **cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment** and (2) emotional classification **using SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions** (**advanced_sentiment_and_emotions.py**) 

All the scripts were written with help from ChatGPT and tested in my local Mac environment.

## How to use
If you're totally new to Python and/or Reddit's API, I suggest pasting the scripts into ChatGPT 4o or Claude 3.7 Sonnet and asking them to walk you through accessing the command line on your local machine and installing Python plus the necessary libraries.
