# AI-vibes-check
Dataset of Reddit posts from profession subreddits discussing AI-related topics.

This repository includes:
1. A dataset of 2,078 Reddit posts collected on 5/19/2025
2. Python script I used to scrape the posts
3. Python script I used to run a prelimiary sentiment analysis on the collected posts using TextBlob. *This confirmed that I need a more sophisticated model to analyze Reddit posts, which can be lengthy and nuanced.*

Both scripts were originally written by ChatGPT and then tested in my local environment. The data scraper works great. The sentiment analysis script basically illustrates that TextBlob is the wrong tool for this job.

## How to use
If you're totally new to Python and/or Reddit's API, I suggest pasting the scripts into ChatGPT 4o or Claude 3.7 Sonnet and asking them to walk you through accessing the command line on your local machine and installing Python plus the necessary libraries.
