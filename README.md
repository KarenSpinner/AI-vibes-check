# AI-vibes-check
Dataset of Reddit posts from profession subreddits discussing AI-related topics.

This repository includes:
1. A dataset of 2,078 Reddit posts collected on 5/19/2025
2. Python script I used to scrape the posts
3. Python script I used to run a sentiment analysis on the collected posts

Both scripts were originally written by ChatGPT and then tested in my local environment.

## How to use
If you're totally new to Python and/or Reddit's API, I suggest pasting the scripts into ChatGPT 4o or Claude 3.7 Sonnet and asking them to walk you through accessing the command line on your local machine and installing Python as well as the necessary libraries.
