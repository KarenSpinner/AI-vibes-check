# AI-vibes-check
Dataset of Reddit posts from **professional and creative subreddits** discussing AI-related topics.

This repository includes:
1. A dataset of 2,078 Reddit posts collected on 5/19/2025 
2. An updated dataset of 2,082 posts collected on 5/20/2025
3. Python script I used to scrape the posts (scrape.py)
4. Python script I used to run a prelimiary sentiment analysis on the collected posts using TextBlob. (sentiment_analysis.oy)
5. Python script I used to run (1) sentiment analysis using cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment and (2) emotional classification using SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions 

All the scripts were written with help from ChatGPT and tested in my local Mac environment.

## How to use
If you're totally new to Python and/or Reddit's API, I suggest pasting the scripts into ChatGPT 4o or Claude 3.7 Sonnet and asking them to walk you through accessing the command line on your local machine and installing Python plus the necessary libraries.
